	- Copy L to R (default): If a cable is connected to a left input, with no cable connected to the corresponding right input, the right input acts as if it has the same signal as the left input,
	in effect giving you a stereo signal where left and right are copies.  
If a cable is connected to a right input, with no cable connected to the corresponding left input, the left input has no signal.
