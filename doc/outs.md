# Outs - additional outputs

This expander goes to the left of the base, and provides some additional outputs for your convenience.

Inputs:
- None.  
Outputs: 
- Dry output provides the same dry audio that's passed to the loops.
- Wet output provides the same wet output available from the base, split into all 16 channels.  
Menu options:
- Wet output mono:
    - Do nothing: does nothing.
    - Add R to L (default): If a cable is connected to a left output, and no cable is connected to the corresponding right output, the signal is the sum of the left and right signals.
